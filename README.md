### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
# Coding Experrience
I have some coding experience. I did a little learning on my own during teh summer on kahn academy. However, outside of that I don't have much.

## Reasons for taking the class
1. I want to get introduced to coding. I think coding is almost a neccesity to learn in our evolving world today no matter what profession you ar einterested in.
2. I am interested in majoring in engineering and I want a coding background so when I learn to code for model and simulations in college its a little easier of a transition.

### Other interests
1. I play soccer.
2. I like robotics.
3. In school I like stem oriented classes like physics.

#### Goals for this class
In this class I just want to get a strong introduction to coding. I want to prepare myself for college, but I also just want to have some fun and create some cool things. I find coding interesting and look foward to learning a lot this year.
